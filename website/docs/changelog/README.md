## 1.1.20 (2020-04-05)

## 1.1.17 (2019-07-29)

*  fixed: The step attribute is set to a decimal point below 1 and scrolls up with a sway.
*  fixed: The offsetWidth is rounded off, causing the error to be calculated. The horizontal scrolling is not on one line, and a blank will appear.
*  fixed: If single-step scrolling is set, the step needs to be a single-numbered divisor, otherwise the position of the single-step scrolling end cannot be guaranteed.
* update: Added navigation configuration, whether the left and right scrolling shows the controller button. When the value is true, autoPlay automatically becomes false.
